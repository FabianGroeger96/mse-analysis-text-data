    "The goal of this first session of the first lab is to get you introduced to an environment that will enable you to run experiments in text analysis for the [TSM AnTeDe](https://moodle.msengineering.ch/course/view.php?id=1303).  We will use the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) programming language, with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks to write instructions and log your results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second and third sessions (separate notebooks 1b and 1c), you will use the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) toolkit to get texts from the web or local files, and segment (split) them into sentences and words.\n",

    "To submit your practical work to the teachers, please execute all cells of your Jupyter notebooks, save them, make a *zip* file with notebooks 1b and 1c, and submit it as homework #1 on the [AnTeDe Moodle page](https://moodle.msengineering.ch/course/view.php?id=1303)."

    "### First option: Conda environment manager\n",
    "If you want to manage several versions of Python and its modules, a good idea is to install an environment manager such as Conda.   Before installing Python and Jupyter locally, installing Conda will help you manage different versions of Python and of other modules on your computer, for instance for several courses.  (You may wish to install Conda before Python, but you can also do it later, in which case it will install its own Python libraries.)\n",

    "\n",
    "* To install Conda, follow the instructions at https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html and consider installing Miniconda. Follow the instructions for your OS: Windows, Linux or MacOS.\n",
    "* You will be prompted to get a suitable installer from https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html (an executable for Windows, or a `bash` script for Linux).\n",
    "* In Linux, run `wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` and then\n",
    "`bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`\n",
    "* Conda commands are the same on all OSs -- the most important ones are for creating and loading an environment\n",
    "* after you install Conda, commands are performed from the command line (command prompt, a Power Shell, Anaconda Prompt, etc.)\n",
    "* try `conda info` for a start.\n",
    "* to get familiar with Conda: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html\n",

    "  * Install then the [Jupyter package](https://jupyter.org/install).  \n",
    "  * A good idea is to use the [Package Installer for Python (pip)](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/) to add new packages.  \n",

The notebook above also gives a very short introduction to [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), which will allow you to plot graphics in Jupyter.  A more thorough introduction is provided by J.R. Johansson in his [Scientific Python Lectures](http://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) accompanied by Jupyter notebooks for practicing.  And of course the definitive reference is the [Python documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/) itself."
